# MultiverseHelloWorld
A fun and extensible C# console project designed to showcase clean architecture, OOP principles, dependency injection, and creativity.

Instead of printing a normal "Hello World", this project prints greetings from multiple fictional universes—each implemented as its own module.

## Features
- Modular design: Each universe is encapsulated in its own class, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Dependency Injection: Uses interfaces and dependency injection to manage dependencies and promote loose coupling.
- Extensibility: Easily add new universes by implementing the `IUniverse` interface.
- Clean Architecture: Follows best practices for maintainable and scalable code.
- Creative Output: Prints unique greetings from various fictional universes.
- Unit Tests: Includes unit tests to ensure each universe module works as expected.
